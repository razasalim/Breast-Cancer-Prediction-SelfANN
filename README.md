# Breast Cancer Prediction Using a Custom Neural Network (No External Libraries Outside of Python)
## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to build a custom artificial neural network (ANN) from scratch to predict outcomes for a specific application, in this case, breast cancer prediction is considered. However, neural network implementation is generalizable and can be adapted for various machine learning tasks based on different applications. This project is developed without using external libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, or NumPy. Instead, all computations, including matrix operations, data loading, standardization, training, and evaluation, are manually implemented using pure Python.

## How the code works:
Please refer to the attached 'Project Description' PDF for details.

## Dependences to Run the Code: 
There are no external dependencies required to run the code. It is designed to run directly on Jupyter notebooks or any other platform supporting .ipynb files, using only Python's built-in functionalities.
